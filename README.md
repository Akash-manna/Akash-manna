I design and operate **cloud-native, distributed software systems** where application logic, data, networking, and infrastructure are treated as a single architectural surface.

For **over eight years**, I’ve worked across **banking, manufacturing, government systems, consulting, GIS-backed platforms, and international products**, taking responsibility for systems that must survive scale, audits, change, and other developers.

My work usually begins where problems are unclear and spans:
- architecture and system boundaries  
- full-stack implementation (web, mobile, UI)  
- DevOps, orchestration, and automation  
- data modeling, audits, and operational integrity  

I don’t build isolated applications.  
I design **multi-language, multi-domain software suites and super-app platforms** that coordinate people, processes, and intelligence.

Much of this work lives in **private repositories and long-running production systems**, which is why public metrics tell only a small part of the story.

### How I Think

- Architecture is a business decision  
- Scale should be structural, not reactive  
- Infrastructure, UI, and data are architectural concerns  
- Automation and intelligence require governance  
- Systems should remain understandable years later

### In Practice

Container-first systems (Docker, Kubernetes),  
workflow and intelligence orchestration (n8n, MCP, agentic patterns),  
relational and NoSQL data models,  
modern web and mobile stacks,  
and platform design meant to be extended by other developers.

**Built in India 🇮🇳. Designed to work across domains, organisations, and time.**

I design systems assuming **other developers, operators, and decision-makers will depend on them long after the first release**.
